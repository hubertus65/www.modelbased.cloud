# Tools 

At Model Based Innovation LLC, we are deeply convinced that open standards are key to achieving smooth collaboration through a Digital thread via open standards. MBI LLC has experience with most tools supporting the standards developed by the [Modelica Association](https://www.modelica.org). We are currently in the process of setting up reseller relationships with several tool and library vendors from the EU to resell their tools in the Americas. We are focusing on the [Modelica](/tools/modelica) language for modeling, the Functional Mockup Interface [FMI](/tools/fmi) for simulation, and System Structure and Parameterization [SSP](https://ssp-standard.org) for system integration and system level simulation. Some tools support all three standards, but often specialized tools are the preferred choice. All Modelica tools support FMI though. Please contact us with any inquiries and stay tuned! 

## Why Should I Use Modelica Modelica Association Standards?

The Modelica Association has created a set of open-source, free to implement standards for authoring, exchanging and integrating system simulation models that are well-tested and proven for robust industrial usage through decades of intensive use in the automotive, aerospace and energy industries.

A language to model and simulate multi-domain cyber physical systems in a standard way, supported by all major CAE vendors. The [Modelica Website](https://modelica.org) has all the resources and details.

FMI, the [Functional Mock-up Interface](https://fmi-standard.org), is a free standard that defines a container and an API to interact with dynamic simulation models using a combination of XML files, binaries, and C code.

SSP, [System Structure and Parameterization](https://ssp-standard.org), is a tool independent standard to define complete systems of one or more FMUs including its parameterization that can be transferred between simulation tools.

## Why Open Standards?

Engineering of complex systems is a team sport, with many companies on the team, most often with one OEM collaborating with many suppliers. If the promised advantages of digital design are to be converted into real gains, simulation models through all design phases have to interoperate seemlessly. The Modelica Association standards are designed to do exactly that, and will allow a more integrated design process between suppliers and OEM. In addition, the standards are are a good insurnace against vendor lock-in and will keep prices in check.
