At your organization, it’s important for your engineering teams to work with simulation tools that are robust enough to give quick and reliable solutions to complex problems. But system simulation doesn’t need to stop there. Bring the benefits of system simulation to your entire organization and partners with Modelon Impact. Modelon Impact is based on open standards such as [Modelica](https://modelica.org) and [FMI](https://fmi-standard.org) and has open APIs that integrate easily with other tools, a necessity for system simulation. Out-of-the box come integrations with Python, Microsoft Excel, and Matlab/Simulink.
