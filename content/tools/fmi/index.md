# Tools based on the FMI Standard 

Model Based Innovation LLC (MBI) has experience with most tools supporting simulation using the [Functional Mockup Interface (FMI)](https://www.fmi-standard.org) standard, both open source and commercial. MBI founder Hubertus Tummescheit has been involved in the development and governenance of the FMI standard from the beginning and is still active in the FMI Steering committee. FMI is a true success story with currently [over 200 tools](https://www.fmi-standard.org/tools) supporting the standard, and the continuing adoption of the standard by additional industries and simulation tools. The versatility and portability of the FMI standard make it the primary choice for cross-tool simulation process automation, using continuous integration techniques to automate testing and reporting of product development progress in an automated way.

## PMSF FMI Bench 

##### Better FMI Integration with a fully-fledged FMI Workbench

Given the increasing complexity of cross-domain integration solutions based on the emerging FMI standard, there is huge potential for incompatibilities and mismatches between all the FMI-based tools in your toolchain. 
PMSF FMIBench lets you effectively link your FMI-based simulation tools through FMU conversion, editing, debugging, pre-integration and customization. 
It also offers support in automating and parallelizing your cross-domain simulations on a vendor-neutral platform, with vendor-neutral standards.

#### FMI Bench Feature Overview

FMI Bench is the true swiss-army-knife equivalent tool for doing anything that might need to be done for connecting and simulating FMUs from various sources. It is the tool of choice for developing and debugging continuous integration simulation worksflows.
