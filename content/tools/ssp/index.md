# Tools based on the SSP Standard 

Model Based Innovation LLC has experience with most tools supporting  the [System Structure and Parameterization ](https://ssp-standard.org) **(SSP)** standard. We are currently in the process of setting up reseller relationships with several tool and library vendors from the EU to resell their tools in the Americas. Please contact us with any inquiries and stay tuned!

Up until now, you have likely documented the specifications directly on the interfaces of your system’s components. Now simply look to the new standard of the Modelica Association: [SSP](https://ssp-standard.org) – System Structure and Parameterization.

With our SSP editor, developing complex system architectures (System Structure) with subsystems and components, along with their relationships to one another and their parameterizations for simulations, has never been so easy. Everything in a single standardized format: SSP.
