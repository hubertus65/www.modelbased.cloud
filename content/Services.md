With our wide-rangin experience, we can support you with a whole spectrum of services, from the design of your processes, teams and workflows to the details of figuring out the right abstraction for your models by applying the right math. We typically use the Systems Engineering Design-Vee, and more sepcifically, all digital, simulation based subset of it, to describe where and how we add business value to your product design.

## Standards
It is our strong conviction, that our customers will do better long-term if their processes and tool chains are based on open standards. Standards make sure that your valuable know-how is not locked up inside a proprietary format, giving you the freedom to choose the best tool for your purpose. We focus on the standards of the Modelica Association with the [Modelica Language](https://modelica.org/language/), commercial and open source [Modelica Libraries](https://modelica.org/libraries/), the [FMI-Standard](https://fmi-standard.org/), and the [SSP-Standard](https://ssp-standard.org/) as the main ones we are supporting.
