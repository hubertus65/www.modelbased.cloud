# Services

The Team from MBI has over 20 years of experience in modeling and simulation, and the development model-based work flows and processes for a wide range of industries. With our wide-ranging experience, we can support you with a whole spectrum of services, from the design of your processes, teams and workflows to the details of figuring out the right abstraction for your models by applying the right math. We typically use the Systems Engineering Design-Vee, and more sepcifically, all digital, simulation based subset of it, to describe where and how we add business value to your product design. 

 - Getting started with model based design, implementing a simulation-based process for product development
 - Tool customization for Modelica-based tools, especially for Modelon Impact.
 - Automation of Modeling and Simulation processes to increase efficiency
 - Custom model- and library development
 - Power plant and process modeling
 - Thermofluid systems modeling, air conditioning, refrigeration 
 - Hydraulic- and Pneumatic system modeling
 - Real time and hardware in the loop/ software in the loop simulation
 - Building web-apps and extensions on top of Modelon Impact

## Training

MBI provides training for Modelica, Model Based Design, all Modelica Association open standards, and for Modelon Impact including most of the Modelon Impact Libraries. The training can be adapted to your team and its maturity on their journey to an efficient team in model based design. Training is available through virtual classes, and for larger groups also as on-site training. Some classes are availabel as video-based on-demand training, please inquire for availability. 

 - Basic Modelica Training
 - Advanced Modelica Training
 - Thermofluid Modeling
 - HVAC System Modeling 
 - Modeling for Control and Control Design with Modelon Impact
 - Best practices for equation based modeling 
 - Designing and detailing workflows and best practices for Model Based Design
 - FMI, the Functional Mockup Interface, and how to effectivly use FMI in collaborative work flows 
 - Tailored courses for research projects using Modelica to make rapid progress early in fast-paced research projects


## Standards
It is our strong conviction, that our customers will do better long-term if their processes and tool chains are based on open standards. Standards make sure that your valuable know-how is not locked up inside a proprietary format, giving you the freedom to choose the best tool for your purpose. We focus on the standards of the Modelica Association with the [Modelica Language](https://modelica.org/language/), commercial and open source [Modelica Libraries](https://modelica.org/libraries/), the [FMI-Standard](https://fmi-standard.org/), and the [SSP-Standard](https://ssp-standard.org/) as the main ones we are supporting.
