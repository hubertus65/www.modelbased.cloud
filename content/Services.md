## Services 

The Team from MBI has over 20 years of experience in modeling and simulation, and the development model-based work flows and processes for a wide range of industries. With our wide-ranging experience, we can support you with a whole spectrum of services, from the design of your processes, teams and workflows to the details of figuring out the right abstraction for your models by applying the right math. We typically use the Systems Engineering Design-Vee, and more sepcifically, all digital, simulation based subset of it, to describe where and how we add business value to your product design. 

### Model Based Design 

Model baased Design is a practical and organizational challenge for companies that have not used it in the past. MBI provides support in starting up from scratch, with training and in supporting specific implementation innitiatives. We have supported organizations of all sizes. Out focus on standards makes sure that the basics are independent of the particular tools. With the exceptionally broad support for FMI, the Functional Mockup Interface, there is a very broad support for system simulation tools.

 - Getting started with model based design, implementing a simulation-based process for product development.
 - Automation of Modeling and Simulation processes to increase efficiency.
 - Real time and hardware in the loop/ software in the loop simulation.

### Modelica Development Services

 - Tool customization for Modelica-based tools, especially for Modelon Impact.
 - Custom model- and library development.
 - Power plant and process modeling.
 - Thermofluid systems modeling, air conditioning, refrigeration.
 - Hydraulic- and Pneumatic system modeling.
 - Building web-apps and extensions on top of Modelon Impact.
 
### Services to implement and support the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI)

 - Product development services based on the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI).
 - Maintenance, update and testing of FMI-based software; 
 - Programming of FMI-based interfaces for electronic control systems; 
 - Development of computer codes and interfaces based on FMI 
 - Engineering services related to implementing the FMI Interface
 - Scientific computer programming services using FMI
 - Consultancy and information services relating to the design, programming and maintenance of FMI-based tools and integrations
 - Computer analysis of vehicle simulations using FMI as integration platform 
 - Computer aided analysis services for real-time or offline vehicle simulations
  
An open-source interface for a connector between FMI 2.0 and [OSLC, Open Services for Life-Cycle Collaboration](https://open-services.net/) is available on our [github](https://github.com/hubertus65/oslc-adapter-fmi) 

### Training

MBI provides training for Modelica, Model Based Design, all Modelica Association open standards, and for Modelon Impact including most of the Modelon Impact Libraries. The training can be adapted to your team and its maturity on their journey to an efficient team in model based design. Training is available through virtual classes, and for larger groups also as on-site training. Some classes are availabel as video-based on-demand training, please inquire for availability. 

 - Basic Modelica Training
 - Advanced Modelica Training
 - Thermofluid Modeling
 - HVAC System Modeling 
 - Modeling for Control and Control Design with Modelon Impact
 - Best practices for equation based modeling 
 - Designing and detailing workflows and best practices for Model Based Design
 - FMI, the Functional Mockup Interface, and how to effectivly use FMI in collaborative work flows 
 - Tailored courses for research projects using Modelica to make rapid progress early in fast-paced research projects


### Standards
It is our strong conviction, that our customers will do better long-term if their processes and tool chains are based on open standards. Standards make sure that your valuable know-how is not locked up inside a proprietary format, giving you the freedom to choose the best tool for your purpose. We focus on the standards of the Modelica Association with the [Modelica Language](https://modelica.org/language/), commercial and open source [Modelica Libraries](https://modelica.org/libraries/), the [FMI-Standard](https://fmi-standard.org/), and the [SSP-Standard](https://ssp-standard.org/) as the main ones we are supporting.
