# Modelica Libraries

MBI LLC has experience with most [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org) Libraries currently available, both open source and commercial. We are working with our partners to introduce these libraries in the Americas and help our customers to become succesful users of them through training and solution services. When working with us, you have the advantage of working with local expert support in the same time zone region, training availability on-site and remote, and support in setting up efficient processes for model based design. 

## Process Engineering and Power-to-X processes

The Process Systems Library by [TLK Energy GmbH](https://tlk-energy.de/en) is the only commercially supported Modelica Library fully dedicated to process engineering. The library provides a wide range of models for general process engineering simulation, but has its focus on transient simulation of Power-to-X processes. The challenge in the Power industry today is primarily to cope with fluctuations of renewable energy production. Traditional, steady-state design tools for such processes are therefore inadequate to capture the true value proposition of Power-to-X processes. This is where the intrinsiccally dynamic nature of Modelica models show its greatest advantage: transient behaviour can be considered already in early design phases. Costly changes late in the design process are thus avoided.

The open code makes it easy for you to look at and understand the equations. It also makes it straight-forward to adapt to your own needs, and keep your core, product-specific IP private to your team.

Thanks to the modular, object-oriented structure, you can flexibly reuse models. This works hand-in-hand with the open code to combine flexibility with easy of use.

Combine our models with models from any other Modelica libraries, such as the TIL Library, and libraries from other domains for full system simulation.
