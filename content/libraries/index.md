# Modelica Libraries

MBI LLC has experience with most [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org) Libraries currently available, both open source and commercial. We are working with our partners to introduce these libraries in the Americas and help our customers to become succesful users of them through training and solution services.

## Process Engineering and Power-to-X processes

The Process Systems Library by [TLK Energy GmbH](https://tlk-energy.de/en) is the only commercially supported Modelica Library fully dedicated to process engineering. The library provides a wide range of models for general process engineering simulation, but has its focus on transient simulation of Power-to-X processes.

We are currently in the process of setting up reseller relationships with several library vendors from Europe to resell their libraries in the Americas. MBI provides support and add-on services for all libraries.
