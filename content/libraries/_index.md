# Modelica Libraries

MBI LLC has experience with most [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org) Libraries currently available, both open source and commercial. We are working with our partners to introduce these libraries in the Americas and help our customers to become succesful users of them through training and solution services. When working with us, you have the advantage of working with local expert support in the same time zone region, training availability on-site and remote, and support in setting up efficient processes for model based design. 

Specialized and supported Modelica Libraries will make your journey to a model based digital product development process much easier and more efficient than startign from scratch.

### Modelica advantages

The open code makes it easy for you to look at and understand the equations. It also makes it straight-forward to adapt to your own needs, and keep your core, product-specific IP private to your team. The openness beats proprietary solutions hands down on transparency and trust.

Thanks to the modular, object-oriented structure of Modelica Libraries, you can flexibly reuse models. This works hand-in-hand with the open code to combine flexibility with easy of use. You achieve the benefits of resue without having to start from scratch.

Combine models from any library with other libraries: Modelica libraries tend to use compatible connectors when the physics are compatible. You can combine any Modelica library with  libraries from other domains for complete system simulation.

One advantage of the Modelica community is the availability of a number of high-quality open source libraries. MBI LLC supports the maintenance and improvement of some of these libraries, and makes sure that they are fully Modelica compliant and 100% cross-tool compatible. If you are discovering an open source library that covers your needs, MBI offers commercial support and development of improvements to such a library. Note that due to the open source nature, improvements should flow back to the upstream library source and available to the general public. Some libraries have been developed mostly for didactic purposes and are primarily aimed at students for getting started.

If and existing open source library does not fulfill your needs, MBI has a broad portfolio of high-quality commercial libraries available that supported, maintained, und have receptive developers that are available to develop private and general availability add-ons to those libraries.

### Custom Libraries and Library extensions

MBI's founder has more than 25 years of experience in developing Modelica library and is the key architect of several of the commercially most successful Modelica Libraries. If you have development needs to extend either an open source, or a commercial library, or you even need a library developed from scratch, MBI will be able to help you with a dedicated team of experienced library developers. For commercial libraries, we work closely with most developers of commercial libraries to explore both dedicated and general availability Library add-ons.
