The HVAC Library by our partner [XRG Simulation GmbH](https://xrg-simulation.de/en) is a commercially supported Modelica Library dedicated to annual building energy use prediction and design. The library provides a wide range of models for building simulation of all types. It has its focus on transient simulation of Buildings and supporting infrastructure with a focus on the long-term transients. The challenge in the Buildings industry today is to design for a reduced carbon footprint through smart design decisions, and smart high-level controls. XRG's HVAC Library has the right level of detail to get to reuslts quickly, and wiht high simulaiton performance. It is a great tool early in the design cycle to design and validate low-carbon building equipment selection, and operational design. Competing Modelica tools do not have this focus and are therefore less efficient in getting to tangible results. The strngth of the HVAC Library is the integrated look at design and efficeint operations, which can easily be adapted to the local climate and energy markets. With respect to model accuracy, the HVAC Library  The dynamic nature of Modelica models, and the freedom to choose the right subset of relevant dynamics show its greatest advantage: transient behaviour can be considered already in early design phases. Costly changes late in the design process are thus avoided.

The open code makes it easy for you to look at and understand the equations. It also makes it straight-forward to adapt to your own needs, and keep your core, product-specific IP private to your team.

The unique concept of the HVAC Library enables the user to carry out whole-year simulations in the shortest possible time (few minutes). Hence, systematic optimizations are becoming possible

The flexibility of the library enables quick realization of a wide variety of buildings.  Combine HVAC models with models from any other Modelica library, such as the XRG Human Comfort Library, and libraries from other domains for full system simulation.

The XRG HVAC Library and HumanComfort Library offer a very flexible and powerful tool to analyze different system layouts and compare their primary energy consumption, their carbon dioxide emission or the energy costs with regard to any reference period (usually one year of operation). Scenarios like a cost optimized system layout with various heating and cooling generation devices can be analyzed within only few minutes. Different concepts of heat recoverage or humidity control can be modeled, simulated and analyzed in a few steps. By using transient models of the HVAC and HumanComfort Library even the thermal behavior of buildings and its interaction with the heating and cooling system are considered in the best way.
