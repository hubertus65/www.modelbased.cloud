### XRG Libraries

XRG is one of the pioneers in the Modelica community ans has a 20 year history of developing Modelica-based Libraries and solutions, proven through use by demanding industrial customers. With the XRG libraries, a large variety of scenarios can be simulated and modeled. Libraries can be extended and customized to customer-specific scenarios upon request. XRG is specialized in modeling and simulation of Buildings, with several dedicated libraries in that domain, as well as mobile HVAC solutions and power plant simulation. XRG also offers a number of applications to increase productivity in modelin gand simulation workflows.  

 - The XRG [HVAC Library](../../libraries/hvac/) offers high performance models for building energy simulations.
