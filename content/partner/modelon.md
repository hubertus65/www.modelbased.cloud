[Modelon](https://www.modelon.com) offers systems modeling and simulation software that accelerates product innovation, development, and operations in a range of industries. Modelon is revolutionizing the engineering design industry by offering technologies and services that enable customers to leverage system simulation. Modelon’s flagship product, Modelon Impact, is a cloud system simulation platform that helps engineers virtually design, analyze, and simulate physical systems. Our team brings deep industry expertise and is dedicated to guiding our customers in creating innovative technologies at their respective organizations. Headquartered in Lund, Sweden, Modelon is a global company with offices in Germany, India, Japan, Prague, and the United States. We believe that system simulation should be accessible to every engineer and are dedicated to being an open-standard platform company."

Modelon shares our belief in open standards and openness as a core value that increases the choice and freedom of our customers. Their flagship-product [Modelon Impact](/tools/modelica/) is fully based on the open standards [Modelica](https://modelica.org) and [FMI](https://fmi-standard.org).

[Modelica](https://modelica.org) is a language to model and simulate multi-domain cyber physical systems in a standard way, supported by all major CAE vendors. Modelon solutions for modeling and simulation and optimization are based on Modelica. Modelica is an independent open-standard for modeling engineering systems. With this open standard, users are enabled to exchange models with any Modelica-compliant tool – utilizing the models for simulation and analysis without the need of a specific tool.

Modelon and MBI are committed to delivering on the promise of open-standard technologies –  enabling any organization to effectively leverage common code system simulation solutions to design and operate their technical systems. We will continue to prove and provide excellence in solutions for simulation based systems design needed to serve any client.
 The [Modelica Website](https://modelica.org) has all the resources and details.

The [Functional Mock-up Interface](https://fmi-standard.org) is a tool independent standard to support both model exchange and co-simulation of dynamic models. FMI is a free standard that defines a container and an API to interact with dynamic simulation models using a combination of XML files, binaries, and C code. FMI is a core component for Modelon and MBI in providing value to our customers. With FMI, plant models developed by experts in advanced simulation tools can be reused across the organization by teams using standard desktop tools. Modelon develops the FMI Toolbox and FMI Toolbox Coder Add-On. In collaboration with Modelon, MBI also develops customized solutions to integrate FMI seamlessly into any workflow.
