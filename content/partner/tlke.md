[TLK-Energy](https://tlk-energy.de/en) is an expert partner in digial engineering methods from Aachen that is specialized in thermal systems and process modeling. Their Process Systes Library is a unique library in the Modelica Ecosystem in that it is specialzied in process engineering. MBI collaborates with TLK Energy on customizations for the Process Systems Library, training, and consutling projects. 

System simulation is TLK-Energy's daily business. Their team surrounding Dr.-Ing. Manuel Gr√§ber and Dr.-Ing. Franz Lanzerath brings experience and best practices from many simulation projects. Thanks to their proximity to research, they are familiar with the latest methods and incorporate them intotheir work and products.

TLK Energy has deep expertise in process simulation, especially for Power-to_X processes with their [Process Systems Library](../../libraries/psl/), and with the TLK TIL Library. 

This enables us to accompany our customers on the fastest path to virtual prototypes, reliably find errors and develop the best solutions.
