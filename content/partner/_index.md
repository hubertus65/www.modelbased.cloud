#### [TLK Thermo GmbH](tlkt)

 {{< TwoC-Table image="/images/tlk_logo_converted.webp" text="TLK-Thermo GmbH was founded in 2003 by managing directors Dr. Nicholas Lemke and Dr. Wilhelm Tegethoff – together with the then director of the thermal science lab at the TU Braunschweig, Prof. Dr. Jürgen Köhler. From the very beginning, the idea was to combine simulation services with the development of software and measurement services. They needed specific programs and test benches to be able to simulate and validate their customers' thermodynamic issues. At the same time, many customers also wanted customized software and individual measurements from us. The fact that this approach - and of course our topics relating to technical thermodynamics - was and is exactly right is reflected not least in TLKs steadily growing order volume. In 2014 and 2015, we founded new branches in Munich and Aachen with our partner companies LTX and TLK-Energy in order to provide support for our expanding customer base in southern and western Germany. The comprehensive thermodynamic expertise that TLK can draw on is based on the profound interdisciplinary knowledge of our employees, most of whom have been with TLK for many years." >}}
