# Our Partners

MBI LLC has partnered with several European companies in the Modelica-space, that all have specialized in certain application areas for which they offer outstanding Modelica related tools and Libraries. 

#### [Modelon AB](modelon)
 {{< TwoC-Table image="/images/modelon-logo.webp" text="Modelon offers systems modeling and simulation software that accelerates product innovation, development, and operations in a range of industries. Modelon is revolutionizing the engineering design industry by offering technologies and services that enable customers to leverage system simulation. Modelon’s flagship product, Modelon Impact, is a cloud system simulation platform that helps engineers virtually design, analyze, and simulate physical systems. Our team brings deep industry expertise and is dedicated to guiding our customers in creating innovative technologies at their respective organizations. Headquartered in Lund, Sweden, Modelon is a global company with offices in Germany, India, Japan, Prague, and the United States. We believe that system simulation should be accessible to every engineer and are dedicated to being an open-standard platform company.  " >}} 

#### [XRG Simulation GmbH](xrg)
 {{< TwoC-Table image="/images/XRGlogo.webp" text="XRG Simulation specializes in calculating the behavior of complex energy systems under dynamic and steady-state conditions. Modeling and simulation using numerical methods are time- and cost-effective, enabling precise calculations of complex systems. In addition, XRG Simulation develops complementary tools such as control and optimization programs, co-simulations, extensive databases, and conducts studies and mathematical optimizations for its clients. MBI collaborates with XRG to bring their products to the US market." >}}

#### [TLK Energy GmbH](tlke)

 {{< TwoC-Table image="/images/TLK_Energy_Logo-dark_converted.webp" text="TLK Energy GmbH wants to enable every engineer and every company to use system simulation. They  believe that the future belongs to digital engineering. By simulating technical systems, they effectively improve production and development processes in companies. They enable customers and colleagues to understand systems and apply simulation based design on their own. MBI partners wtih TLK energy to bring their user-oriented library products to the US market." >}} 

#### [TLK Thermo GmbH](tlkt)

 {{< TwoC-Table image="/images/tlk_logo_converted.webp" text="TLK-Thermo GmbH was founded in 2003 by managing directors Dr. Nicholas Lemke and Dr. Wilhelm Tegethoff – together with the then director of the thermal science lab at the TU Braunschweig, Prof. Dr. Jürgen Köhler. From the very beginning, the idea was to combine simulation services with the development of software and measurement services. They needed specific programs and test benches to be able to simulate and validate their customers' thermodynamic issues. At the same time, many customers also wanted customized software and individual measurements from us. The fact that this approach - and of course our topics relating to technical thermodynamics - was and is exactly right is reflected not least in TLKs steadily growing order volume. In 2014 and 2015, we founded new branches in Munich and Aachen with our partner companies LTX and TLK-Energy in order to provide support for our expanding customer base in southern and western Germany. The comprehensive thermodynamic expertise that TLK can draw on is based on the profound interdisciplinary knowledge of our employees, most of whom have been with TLK for many years." >}}
